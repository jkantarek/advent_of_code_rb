# AdventOfCodeRb

This is a return to basics for ruby fundimentals with minimal extra dependencies. This work will be largely test driven to make it easier to follow along with logic

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/advent_of_code_rb`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation

This is not a gem to be installed anywhere, good luck if you try to!

## Usage

use `rake generate:new_day` to create a new file harness and test for the day. This will automatically scan the folders for the correct next day to create using sequential order.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
